                                The arbitrator is not empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory damages, and
                                each party
                                hereby irrevocably waives any right to recover such damages with respect to any Dispute
                                resolved by
                                arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator will be in accordance with these Terms and
                                will be
                                binding upon the parties. Each party hereby waives any right it may otherwise have under
                                the laws of
                                any jurisdiction to any form of appeal. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered
                                in and
                                enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction having jurisdiction over both parties.
                                The
                                arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any
                                claim; however,
                                a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a
                                class-wide basis or
                                in a representative capacity. These Terms govern if there is a conflict with the AAA or
                                the ICDR
                                rules as applicable.

                                Excluded Disputes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party is required to arbitrate
                                claims:
                                <br>
                                (1)
                                where all named parties seek monetary relief which, in the aggregate, qualifies as a
                                claim that
                                meets the requirements of an applicable small claims court;
                                <br>
                                (2) seeking injunctive relief; or
                                <br>
                                (3)
                                seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or SnapCor’s
                                intellectual
                                property rights. However, if a small claim is transferred, removed, or appealed to a
                                different
                                court, either party may require that the claim be submitted to final binding
                                arbitration.
                                <br>

                                DISPUTE, WHETHER RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE, WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN

                                ARBITRATION, AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SNAPCOR AGREE

                                ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE

                                as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will
                                be resolved
                                in a court of competent jurisdiction, with the balance resolved through arbitration.
                                If any provision of this Dispute Resolution section is found to be illegal or
                                unenforceable, then
                                that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions will still apply and
